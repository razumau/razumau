At Zendesk, I work on a Ruby Platform Core team: we create solutions for common problems, help teams with upgrades of Ruby and Rails, write guides, and create tooling for this work. 

Outside Zendesk, I work on improving ChGK (think of it as a more competitive pub quiz with better questions and about 10k monthly active players in ranked tournaments; see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What%3F_Where%3F_When%3F#Competitive_game)), which includes thing like [the official ranking system](https://github.com/chgk-gg/rating-ui), [a fantasy game](https://fantasy.razumau.net/), and [a bot for selecting the best questions of a year](https://github.com/razumau/questions_vote).

You can also find me on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3914248-jury-razumau) and [Hardcover](https://hardcover.app/@razumau).
